## Requirements

Developed and tested on Redmine 3.0, Ruby version 2.1

## Installation

1. Go to your Redmine installation's plugins/directory.
2. `git clone https://github.com/efigence/redmine_imperator`
3. run `bundle install`
4. Go back to root directory.
5. `bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production`
6. Restart Redmine.

## Plugin Development & Testing

When adding new gems, they may conflict with Redmine's gems, so always run bundle first from redmine repository to be able to generate next a compatible Gemfile.lock in the plugin dir.

```
cd ~/redmine/
bundle install
cd ~/redmine/plugins/redmine_imperator/
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
cp config/settings.yml.example config/settings.yml

# run tests
cd ~/redmine/
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:test NAME=redmine_imperator
```

## Tests can be run inside a plugin, but additional setup is required

```
# first, follow instructions from: https://github.com/dadooda/bundler-gemlocal
# if you use ~/.bash_profile separately from ~/.bashrc, also source the .sh file there
cd ~/redmine/plugins/redmine_imperator/

# copy config files
cp Gemlocal.example Gemlocal

# install local gems
b install --path vendor/bundle

# run tests inside the plugin
bx rake test

# generate documentation for the plugin
bx rake rdoc
```
